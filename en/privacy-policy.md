- We collect and use your personal information without obtaining your explicit consent;
- Our processing of personal information seriously violates our agreement with you;
- You no longer use our services, or you actively cancel your account;
- We permanently no longer provide services to you.

(Note: If information deletion involves our fulfillment of obligations stipulated by laws and regulations (such as storing transaction records) or there are other circumstances where the law allows retention, we may not be able to immediately respond to your deletion request.)

### Withdrawal of Consent
For personal information processing activities based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. After withdrawing consent, we will no longer process the corresponding personal information, but this does not affect the validity of personal information processing activities that have been conducted based on your consent before withdrawal.

Your continued use of this Service after the updated Policy takes effect indicates that you agree to accept the revised Policy content.** If you do not agree with the updated Policy, you should stop using this Service and cancel your account.

## Minor Protection

**This Service is mainly for adults. We attach great importance to the protection of minors' personal information.**

**If you are a minor under 14 years old, please carefully read this Policy under the guidance of your parents or other guardians, and use our services or provide information after obtaining the consent of your parents or other guardians.**

If you are a parent or guardian of a minor, please pay attention to whether the minor under your guardianship is using our services with your consent. If you have any questions about how we handle minors' personal information or believe that we may have collected information about minors, please contact us through the contact information in this Policy. If we find that we have collected personal information of minors without first obtaining verifiable parental consent, we will try to delete the relevant data as soon as possible.

## Cross-border Data Transfer

**Due to the characteristics of cloud services, in order to provide you with a global service experience (such as when you choose to deploy resources in overseas regions), your personal information may need to be transmitted to and stored on servers outside China.** You understand and agree to such cross-border transfer behavior. When conducting cross-border data transfer, we will strictly comply with the requirements of Chinese laws and regulations (for example, conduct necessary security assessments), and take effective measures such as contractual constraints (such as adopting standard contractual clauses) and data encryption to ensure that your personal information receives sufficient security protection during transmission and storage, with protection standards not lower than the requirements of Chinese law. You can understand the data storage location through the service region selection function we provide (if applicable).
