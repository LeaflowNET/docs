## 5. User Rights

According to relevant Chinese laws and regulations, you have the following rights regarding your personal information (subject to compliance with legal requirements):

You have the right to access personal information about you that we hold. If you find that your personal information is incorrect or incomplete, you can correct or supplement it through account settings or by contacting us.

### Deletion
In the following circumstances, you can request us to delete personal information:

- We collect and use your personal information without obtaining your explicit consent;
- Our processing of personal information seriously violates our agreement with you;
- You no longer use our services, or you actively cancel your account;
- We permanently no longer provide services to you.

(Note: If information deletion involves our fulfillment of obligations stipulated by laws and regulations (such as storing transaction records) or there are other circumstances where the law allows retention, we may not be able to immediately respond to your deletion request.)

### Withdraw Consent
For personal information processing activities based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. After withdrawing consent, we will no longer process the corresponding personal information, but this does not affect the validity of personal information processing activities that have been conducted based on your consent before withdrawal. Withdrawing consent may result in your inability to continue using service functions that require such information.

After account cancellation, we will stop providing services to you and delete your personal information or anonymize it according to applicable laws and this Policy (except as otherwise provided by laws and regulations or for legitimate purposes such as security and fraud detection).

### Response to Requests
For security purposes, you may need to provide written requests or prove your identity in other ways. We may first require you to verify your identity before processing your request. For reasonable requests, we generally do not charge fees, but for multiple repeated requests that exceed reasonable limits, we may charge certain cost fees. We will reply to your request within the time limit stipulated by laws and regulations (usually 15 or 30 working days).

## 6. Privacy Policy Updates

Your continued use of this Service after the updated policy takes effect indicates that you agree to accept the revised policy content.** If you do not agree with the updated policy, you should stop using this Service and cancel your account.

## 7. Protection of Minors

**This Service is primarily intended for adults. We attach great importance to the protection of personal information of minors.**

**If you are a minor under 14 years old, please carefully read this Policy under the guidance of your parents or other guardians, and use our services or provide information after obtaining the consent of your parents or other guardians.**

If you are a parent or guardian of a minor, please pay attention to whether the minor under your guardianship uses our services with your consent. If you have any questions about how we handle personal information of minors or believe we may have collected information about minors, please contact us through the contact information in this Policy. If we discover that we have collected personal information of minors without first obtaining verifiable parental consent, we will try to delete the relevant data as soon as possible.

## 8. Cross-border Data Transfer

**Due to the nature of cloud services, to provide you with a global service experience (such as when you choose to deploy resources in overseas regions), your personal information may need to be transmitted to and stored on servers outside China.** You understand and agree to such cross-border transfer behavior. When conducting cross-border data transfers, we will strictly comply with Chinese legal requirements (for example, conducting necessary security assessments), and adopt effective measures such as contractual constraints (such as using standard contractual clauses) and data encryption to ensure that your personal information receives adequate security protection during transmission and storage, with protection standards no lower than those required by Chinese law. You can learn about data storage locations through the service region selection function we provide (if applicable).
